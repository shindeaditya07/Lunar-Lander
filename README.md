A Lunar Lander is a classic reinforcement learning problem where an autonomous agent needs to learn how to land a spacecraft on the surface of the moon. 
Deep Q-Learning (DQN) is a popular technique in reinforcement learning that combines Q-learning with deep neural networks to handle complex and high-dimensional state spaces. PyTorch is a popular deep learning framework that can be used to implement DQN.

1. Environment Setup:
   - Use a lunar landing simulator as the environment for the agent to learn in. OpenAI Gym provides a LunarLander environment that you can use.

2. State Representation:
   - Represent the state of the lunar lander using relevant features such as position, velocity, angle, and angular velocity.

3. Action Space:
   - Define the action space, which typically includes actions like firing the left or right engine, doing nothing, or firing both engines.

4. Deep Q-Network (DQN) Model:
   - Create a neural network model using PyTorch that takes the state as input and outputs Q-values for each possible action. This network serves as the Q-function approximator.

5. Experience Replay:
   - Implement an experience replay buffer to store and randomly sample past experiences (state, action, reward, next state) to break the temporal correlation in the data and improve learning stability.

6. Epsilon-Greedy Exploration:
   - Implement epsilon-greedy strategy for exploration, where the agent with probability epsilon chooses a random action, and with probability 1-epsilon, it chooses the action with the highest Q-value.

7. Loss Function and Optimization:
   - Define the loss function, typically the mean squared Bellman error, and use an optimizer (e.g., Adam) to update the Q-network parameters.

8. Training Loop:
   - Iterate through episodes and within each episode, let the agent interact with the environment, collect experiences, and update the Q-network using the DQN algorithm.

9. Target Q-Network:
   - Implement a target Q-network to stabilize training. The target Q-network is a separate network with delayed updates.

10. Fine-Tuning and Hyperparameter Tuning:
    - Experiment with different hyperparameters, such as learning rate, discount factor, batch size, and neural network architecture, to fine-tune the performance of the lunar lander agent.

11. Evaluation:
    - Evaluate the trained agent by running it in the lunar landing environment and observing its performance.
